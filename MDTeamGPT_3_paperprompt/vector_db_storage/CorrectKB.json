A total of 125 participants with autism (mean age: 12 years) were recruited for the study and took part in weekly social skills training sessions for 3 months. Participants were recruited from support groups in a large Northeastern US city for parents with autistic children. Parents in the support group were very eager to volunteer for the study, and over 300 children were placed on a waiting list while the study was conducted. At baseline and at the end of the 3-month period, participants were observed during a videotaped social play exercise and scored on a social interaction rating scale by their parents. Social interaction rating scores following the 3-month intervention were more than twice as high as baseline scores (p < 0.001).
