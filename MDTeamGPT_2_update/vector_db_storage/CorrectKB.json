    "Question": "A 37-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain. She reports that the pain is not new and usually starts within half an hour of eating a meal. The pain has been previously diagnosed as biliary colic, and she underwent a cholecystectomy three months ago for symptomatic biliary colic. Her liver reportedly looked normal at that time. The patient dates the onset of these episodes to shortly after she underwent a sleeve gastrectomy several years ago, and the episodes were more severe immediately following that surgery. Her postsurgical course was otherwise uncomplicated, and she has lost fifty pounds since then. She has a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis, and obesity. She denies alcohol or tobacco use. Her home medications are hydrochlorothiazide, enalapril, atorvastatin, and vitamin supplements. RUQ ultrasound reveals a surgically absent gallbladder and a dilated common bile duct without evidence of stones. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) shows no evidence of biliary compression or obstruction, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) shows no evidence of biliary stones or sludge. Laboratory tests are performed which reveal the following:\n\nALT: 47 U/L\nAST: 56 U/L\nAlkaline phosphatase: 165 U/L\nTotal bilirubin: 1.6 g/dL\nAmylase: 135 U/L\nLipase: 160 U/L\n\nWhich of the following is definitive treatment of this patient's condition?",

    "Question": "A 29-year-old patient presents to her primary care physician with persistent amenorrhea and inability to breastfeed over the last 5 months. She says that she has also been very tired since her baby was born and this fatigue was accompanied by an inability to deal with cold weather despite having no problem with cold prior to becoming pregnant. She has gained an additional 5 pounds since delivery. Review of her hospital records reveals that she had a vaginal delivery that was complicated by severe hemorrhage and episodes of hypotension. Which of the following hormone levels is most likely to be normal in this patient?",
    "Correct Answer": "{E}: {Aldosterone}",
    "Summary": "All specialists (endocrinologist, ob/gyn, and hematologist) agree that aldosterone is the most likely hormone to be normal in this patient. This is because aldosterone production is not dependent on the pituitary gland, unlike other hormones such as FSH, prolactin, thyroid hormone, or cortisol, which are pituitary-dependent and thus likely to be low in Sheehan's syndrome. Aldosterone is regulated by the renin-angiotensin system and potassium levels, making it less affected by pituitary dysfunction."
